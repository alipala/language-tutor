```bash
# First merge feature branch to main
git checkout main
git merge feature/stripe-integration
git push origin main

# Then deploy
railway up --detach
```

## ⚠️ **IMPORTANT PRODUCTION SETUP TASKS**

### **1. Stripe Webhook Configuration**
After deployment, you need to:
1. Go to Stripe Dashboard → Webhooks
2. Create a new webhook endpoint: `https://mytacoai.com/api/stripe/webhook`
3. Select these events:
   - `customer.subscription.created`
   - `customer.subscription.updated` 
   - `customer.subscription.deleted`
   - `invoice.payment_succeeded`
   - `invoice.payment_failed`
4. Copy the webhook signing secret
5. Update Railway environment variable:
   ```bash
   railway variables --set "STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_actual_webhook_secret_from_stripe"
   ```

### **2. Stripe Product & Price Setup**
Ensure your Stripe account has:
- ✅ Products created (Try & Learn, Fluency Builder, Team Mastery)
- ✅ Prices configured for monthly/annual billing
- ✅ Price IDs match those in your frontend code

### **3. Domain Configuration**
- ✅ Domain already configured: `mytacoai.com`
- ✅ SSL certificate should be automatically handled by Railway

## 🧪 **POST-DEPLOYMENT TESTING**

After deployment, test these features:

### **Subscription Flow**
1. ✅ Create new subscription via Stripe Checkout
2. ✅ View subscription status in profile
3. ✅ Cancel subscription (should show "Canceling" status)
4. ✅ Reactivate subscription (should return to "Active")
5. ✅ Check membership badge updates in real-time

### **API Endpoints to Test**

- `POST /api/stripe/cancel-subscription`
- `POST /api/stripe/reactivate-subscription`
- `POST /api/stripe/create-checkout-session`
