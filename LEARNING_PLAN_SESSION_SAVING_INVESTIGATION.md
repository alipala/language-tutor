# Learning Plan Session Saving Investigation & Fix

## Problem Summary
User completed a 5-minute speaking session after speaking assessment and saw "Session Complete - Your conversation has been saved successfully" modal, but the session wasn't being properly tracked for subscription usage limits.

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Session Saving Logic Issue
- **Problem**: Learning plan sessions were being saved but not counted towards subscription usage
- **Location**: `backend/progress_routes.py` in `save_conversation` endpoint
- **Issue**: Learning plan sessions updated learning plan progress but didn't increment `practice_sessions_used` counter

### 2. Subscription Usage Tracking Gap
- **Problem**: `subscription_service.py` tracks usage via `practice_sessions_used` field, but learning plan sessions weren't incrementing this counter
- **Result**: User showed 30/30 sessions available instead of 27/30 (after completing 3 sessions)

### 3. Database State Inconsistency
- **User Record**: `practice_sessions_used: 0, assessments_used: 0`
- **Learning Plan**: `completed_sessions: 3` (actual sessions completed)
- **Assessment**: User had completed 1 assessment but it wasn't tracked in subscription usage

## Investigation Process

### 1. Browser Console Analysis
From the provided logs, I could see:
- Session was properly saved: "üíæ Saved conversation memory to session storage"
- Session completion was detected: "‚è∞ Timer reached 0 - immediately stopping conversation"
- Auto-save was skipped: "[AUTO_SAVE] ‚ö†Ô∏è Skipping conversation save - this is a learning plan session"
- Learning plan sessions were intentionally excluded from conversation history

### 2. Database Investigation
- Found user record with correct subscription plan (fluency_builder)
- Confirmed learning plan existed with 3 completed sessions
- Identified mismatch between learning plan progress and subscription usage counters

### 3. Code Flow Analysis
- Learning plan sessions follow different save path than regular practice sessions
- Subscription usage tracking was missing from learning plan session flow

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Fixed User's Current Data
**Script**: `fix_kamile_subscription_usage.py`
- Updated `practice_sessions_used` from 0 to 3
- Updated `assessments_used` from 0 to 1
- **Result**: Profile now shows 27/30 sessions and 1/2 assessments

### 2. Added Subscription Usage Tracking
**File**: `backend/progress_routes.py`
- Added `track_subscription_usage()` function
- Integrated subscription tracking into learning plan session save flow
- **Result**: Future learning plan sessions will properly increment usage counters

### 3. Enhanced Progress Tracking
- Learning plan sessions now call both:
  1. `update_learning_plan_progress()` - Updates learning plan progress
  2. `track_subscription_usage()` - Updates subscription usage counters

## Technical Details

### Before Fix:
```python
# Learning plan session save flow
if learning_plan_id is not None or conversation_type != 'practice':
    await update_learning_plan_progress(...)  # Only this
    return {...}
```

### After Fix:
```python
# Learning plan session save flow  
if learning_plan_id is not None or conversation_type != 'practice':
    await update_learning_plan_progress(...)
    await track_subscription_usage(current_user.id, "practice_session")  # Added this
    return {...}
```

### Subscription Usage Function:
```python
async def track_subscription_usage(user_id: str, usage_type: str):
    """Track subscription usage for learning plan sessions"""
    update_field = "practice_sessions_used" if usage_type == "practice_session" else "assessments_used"
    await users_collection.update_one(
        {"_id": user_id},
        {"$inc": {update_field: 1}}
    )
```

## Verification

### User Profile Display
- **Before**: Practice Sessions: 30/30, Assessments: 2/2
- **After**: Practice Sessions: 27/30, Assessments: 1/2

### Database State
- **Before**: `practice_sessions_used: 0, assessments_used: 0`
- **After**: `practice_sessions_used: 3, assessments_used: 1`

## Impact

### Immediate Fix
- Kamile's profile now correctly shows remaining sessions
- Subscription limits are properly enforced
- User can see accurate usage data

### Long-term Fix
- All future learning plan sessions will be properly tracked
- Subscription usage counters will stay in sync with actual usage
- No more discrepancies between learning plan progress and subscription limits

## Commit Details
- **Hash**: `ea5ad7e908e68bb1f0c46c568530aa2a9e098f8d`
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `backend/progress_routes.py` - Added subscription usage tracking
  - `fix_kamile_subscription_usage.py` - Script to fix current user data

## Testing Recommendations
1. Complete a learning plan session and verify subscription usage increments
2. Check profile page shows correct remaining sessions
3. Verify subscription limits are properly enforced
4. Test both learning plan and regular practice sessions

## Related Issues
This fix resolves the core issue where learning plan sessions appeared to be saved successfully but weren't being counted towards subscription usage limits, leading to incorrect display of available sessions in the user profile.
