# Weekly Schedule Tracking Fix Summary

## Issue Description
The weekly schedule in the language-tutor project was not correctly displaying the status of completed sessions. Specifically:
- Week 1 with 2/2 sessions completed was showing as blue (in-progress) instead of green (completed)
- Week 2 with 0/2 sessions was correctly showing as upcoming, but should show as blue (in-progress) when it becomes the current week

## Root Cause Analysis
The frontend components were using the global `completed_sessions` field to calculate week status instead of using the individual week's `sessions_completed` field from the `weekly_schedule` array in MongoDB.

### Database Data (Confirmed via MongoDB Investigation)
```json
{
  "completed_sessions": 2,
  "total_sessions": 24,
  "plan_content": {
    "weekly_schedule": [
      {
        "week": 1,
        "sessions_completed": 2,
        "total_sessions": 2,
        "focus": "Addressing key improvement areas: Minor improvements in pronunciation..."
      },
      {
        "week": 2,
        "sessions_completed": 0,
        "total_sessions": 2,
        "focus": "Addressing key improvement areas: Minor improvements in pronunciation..."
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Files Modified

### 1. Frontend Components
- **`frontend/components/assessment-learning-plan-card.tsx`**
  - Updated TypeScript interface to include `sessions_completed` and `total_sessions` in weekly_schedule
  - Modified week status calculation logic to use individual week data
  - Fixed both the main weekly schedule display and detailed plan view

- **`frontend/components/dashboard/LearningPlanDetailsModal.tsx`**
  - Updated week status calculation to use individual week's `sessions_completed` field
  - Fixed progress display to show correct session counts per week

- **`frontend/lib/learning-api.ts`**
  - Updated TypeScript interface to include missing properties in weekly_schedule

### 2. Investigation Tools
- **`investigate_weekly_schedule_issue.py`**
  - Created MongoDB connection script to verify production data
  - Confirmed the issue and validated the fix approach

## Technical Changes

### Before (Incorrect Logic)
```typescript
// Using global completed_sessions to calculate week status
const completedWeeks = Math.floor((learningPlan.completed_sessions || 0) / sessionsPerWeek);
const currentWeek = Math.min(completedWeeks + 1, totalWeeks);
```

### After (Correct Logic)
```typescript
// Using individual week's sessions_completed to determine status
const weekSessionsCompleted = week.sessions_completed || 0;
const weekTotalSessions = week.total_sessions || sessionsPerWeek;

if (weekSessionsCompleted >= weekTotalSessions) {
  weekStatus = 'completed';  // GREEN
} else if (weekSessionsCompleted > 0) {
  weekStatus = 'current';    // BLUE (in-progress)
} else {
  weekStatus = 'upcoming';   // GRAY
}
```

## Expected UI Behavior After Fix

### Week Status Colors
- **Green with Checkmark**: Week is completed (`sessions_completed >= total_sessions`)
- **Blue with Clock**: Week is in progress (`sessions_completed > 0 && sessions_completed < total_sessions`)
- **Gray with Number**: Week is upcoming (`sessions_completed === 0`)

### For the Test Case
- **Week 1**: 2/2 sessions → **GREEN** ✅ (Completed)
- **Week 2**: 0/2 sessions → **GRAY** ⏳ (Upcoming, will become BLUE when user starts)

## Backend Verification
The backend correctly updates individual week `sessions_completed` fields:
- `backend/main.py` - Updates weekly schedule progress
- `backend/progress_routes.py` - Handles session completion tracking
- `backend/learning_routes.py` - Creates weekly schedule with proper structure

## Git Branch
Created feature branch: `fix-weekly-schedule-tracking`

## Testing
1. ✅ MongoDB production data verified
2. ✅ Frontend TypeScript interfaces updated
3. ✅ Component logic fixed for both main and detailed views
4. 🔄 Ready for UI testing

## Next Steps
1. Test the UI changes in development environment
2. Verify the fix works with the production data
3. Deploy to production
4. Monitor for any edge cases
