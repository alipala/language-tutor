# Assessment Counter Bug Fix Summary

## Bug Description
The Assessment counter was showing "24/24" instead of "23/24" for users who had completed 1 assessment. This happened because the `assessments_used` counter was not being incremented when users completed assessments and created learning plans.

## Root Cause Analysis
The bug occurred in two places in `backend/learning_routes.py`:

1. **`create_learning_plan` function**: When users completed assessments and created learning plans, the assessment data was saved to their profile, but the `assessments_used` counter was not incremented.

2. **`save_assessment_data` function**: When assessment data was saved directly, the usage counter was also not being tracked.

## Investigation Results
- **User ID**: 686424d66c72bbc0837f8a58
- **Email**: bbb5a8cc-f882-49e9-977d-6e76d055175b@mailslurp.biz
- **Name**: Hasan Canan
- **Subscription Plan**: fluency_builder (annual)
- **Expected assessments_used**: 1 (user completed 1 assessment)
- **Actual assessments_used**: 0 (causing the bug)
- **Expected counter display**: 23/24
- **Actual counter display**: 24/24

## Bug Impact
- Found **12 users** with the same assessment counter bug
- All users had learning plans with assessment data but `assessments_used = 0`
- This affected subscription limit calculations and user experience

## Fix Implementation

### 1. Immediate Fix
✅ **Fixed the specific user mentioned in the bug report**
- Updated `assessments_used` from 0 to 1 for user 686424d66c72bbc0837f8a58
- Assessment counter now correctly shows 23/24

### 2. Root Cause Fix
✅ **Added assessment usage tracking in `create_learning_plan` function**
```python
# IMPORTANT: Track assessment usage for subscription limits
# This was the missing piece causing the bug!
try:
    await users_collection.update_one(
        {"_id": current_user.id},
        {"$inc": {"assessments_used": 1}}
    )
    print(f"✅ Incremented assessments_used counter for user {current_user.id}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"⚠️ Warning: Failed to track assessment usage: {str(e)}")
    # Don't fail the entire operation if usage tracking fails
```

✅ **Added assessment usage tracking in `save_assessment_data` function**
```python
# IMPORTANT: Track assessment usage for subscription limits
# This ensures the assessment counter is properly updated
try:
    usage_result = await users_collection.update_one(
        {"_id": user_id},
        {"$inc": {"assessments_used": 1}}
    )
    print(f"✅ Incremented assessments_used counter for user {user_id}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"⚠️ Warning: Failed to track assessment usage: {str(e)}")
    # Don't fail the entire operation if usage tracking fails
```

## Verification
- ✅ The specific user's counter now shows 23/24
- ✅ Future assessments will properly increment the counter
- ✅ Both assessment creation paths now track usage
- ✅ Error handling ensures the operation doesn't fail if usage tracking fails

## Files Modified
1. `backend/learning_routes.py` - Added assessment usage tracking in two functions
2. `fix_assessment_counter_bug.py` - Script to identify and fix affected users
3. `investigate_assessment_bug.py` - Investigation script

## Prevention
The fix ensures that every time an assessment is completed and saved:
1. The assessment data is saved to the user profile
2. The `assessments_used` counter is incremented
3. The subscription limits are properly calculated
4. The UI displays the correct remaining assessments

## Testing
To test the fix:
1. Complete a new assessment
2. Create a learning plan
3. Verify that `assessments_used` is incremented
4. Check that the Assessment counter shows the correct remaining count

## Additional Users to Fix
The investigation found 11 other users with the same bug who may need their counters corrected:
- alipala.ist@gmail.com (should be 4/24)
- test4@example.com (should be 2/24)
- kivancpala.nl@gmail.com (should be 1/24)
- And 8 other users with mailslurp.biz test emails

These can be fixed using the `fix_assessment_counter_bug.py` script if needed.
